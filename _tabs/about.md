#  Hi

I'm Haotian MA,a doctoral researcher at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/) focusing on data-driven method to acclerate the arrival of sustainable energy future.

I have a strong academic background in computer engineering, including completion of the [Institute of Data,System and Society,MIT](https://idss.mit.edu/) Summer Program and obtained a master's degree from the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/), I've finished impactful projects at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) and the [Global Energy Interconnection Research Institute](https://geiri.eu/). My bachelor's degree in engineering was obtained from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) includes honors and multiple awards for energy projects,and finally rewarded as 2019 outstanding graduates of SEU.
